This is my workspace (which is compressed in a rar file).

I have created a simple form to enter a product value through a text field and saving into firebase database by clicking submit button.

The JSON value I got is similar to that mentioned in the step 1

small instance of JSON file from my firebasedatabase

{
  "products" : {
    "-KgIRdZOsghGA2HwEa08" : {
      "pid" : "-KgIRdZOsghGA2HwEa08",
      "pname" : "Product Namemounica"
    },
    "-KgIRwq3Rd5Hr1dHtUFq" : {
      "pid" : "-KgIRwq3Rd5Hr1dHtUFq",
      "pname" : "book"
    }
  }
}
